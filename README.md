​
## Creating a Clear and Responsive Personal Portfolio

### Live site at [CG Sibley Design](https://cgsdesign.github.io/portfolio/)
### Code at [CG Sibley Design Github](https://github.com/cgsdesign/portfolio)
​
​For this project I created a personal webpage for my portfolio. The goal was to create a clear and concise page to describe me, show my work, and allow others to contact me.
The branding follows my personal print collateral. The page is designed to be fully responsive and intuitive in order to bring in recruiters and future employers.​

* live contact links as well as links to my github
* organized CSS by page flow
* concise CSS
* clear internal documentation
* semantic HTML5 elements
* clear and concise page title
